# Lab02-UnitTestsAndDocumentation

Author: Ameilia Valdes

## Overview
This is a console app that mimics an ATM, allowing the user to view their "balance," make "deposits," and "withdrawls." Each non-void method also has 2 unit tests.
## Getting Started
The app begins with a simple user interface where the user must choose a numbered option out of 4 preset functions. The "transactions" are tracked and the user may view their balance at any time. The user must enter a positive valid decimal, and cannot over draw their account.
## Example

## Architecture
This app and its tests are written in c# runnig on .NET Core.
